	<p>A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administratorâ€™s rules regarding user behavior and provides information about the actions the website administrator can and will perform.

Essentially, your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and its users. In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look at it to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

Creating the best terms and conditions page possible will protect your business from the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Abusive users:</b> Terms and Conditions agreements allow you to establish what constitutes appropriate activity on your site or app, empowering you to remove abusive users and content that violates your guidelines.</li>
<li><b>Intellectual property theft: </b>Asserting your claim to the creative assets of your site in your terms and conditions will prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement.</li></li>
<li><b>Potential litigation: </b>If a user lodges a legal complaint against your business, showing that they were presented with clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help you immensely in court.</li>
</ul>
In short, terms and conditions give you control over your site and legal enforcement if users try to take advantage of your operations.</p>
<p>Note that you'll sometimes see this agreement referred to as a Terms of Use, User Agreement or Terms of Service agreement. These terms are interchangeable and refer to the same type of agreement.

The purpose of a Terms and Conditions agreement is to prevent misunderstandings between the business owner (you), and the consumer. The agreement helps you:

Protect your intellectual property
Avoid website abuse
Define the limits of your legal obligations to the consumer
Essentially, the T&C helps you run your business more effectively and with greater peace of mind.

This agreement forms the basis of an enforceable legal relationship. It tells anyone browsing your website, whether they are a casual visitor or an active client, what their legal responsibilities and rights are.

It also gives you, as the business owner and service provider, authority over certain undesirable things that a consumer may do on your website. However, let's consider the specific reasons why business owners should always include a Terms and Conditions agreement on their website.</p>
